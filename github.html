As a beginner, here are some essential steps to get started with GitHub:

Create a GitHub Account:

Sign up for a free account on GitHub.
Create a Repository:

A repository (repo) is where your project lives. Create a new repository by clicking the "New" button on your GitHub homepage.
Give your repository a name and description, and decide if it should be public or private.
Install Git:

Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history. Install Git from here.
Clone a Repository:

Clone a repository to your local machine with the command:
git clone https://github.com/username/repository.git
Make Changes:

Navigate to the repository directory on your local machine and make changes to the files or add new ones.
Commit Changes:

Save your changes in Git with the command:
Code
git add .
git commit -m "Your commit message"
Push Changes:

Push your changes back to GitHub with the command:
git push origin main
Create a Branch:

Branches allow you to work on different features separately. Create a new branch with:
git checkout -b new-branch-name
Create a Pull Request:

When you're ready to merge your changes, push your branch to GitHub and create a pull request from the GitHub website.
Collaborate:

Collaborate with others by reviewing and commenting on pull requests, opening issues to report bugs or suggest features, and using GitHub Discussions.
